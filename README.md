# Vehicle Dynamics Dashboard

![Welcome Screen](assets/welcome_page.png)

An interactive **Vehicle Dynamics & Yaw Stability Control Dashboard** developed using **Python** and **Streamlit** for real-time visualization of lateral vehicle dynamics, tire behaviour, and ESC intervention.

The project combines a nonlinear 2-DOF vehicle model with a Pacejka tire model and a predictive Electronic Stability Control (ESC) strategy to simulate realistic vehicle handling behaviour under varying driving conditions.
